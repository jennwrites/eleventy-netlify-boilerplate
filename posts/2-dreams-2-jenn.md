### First Dream
I’m back home, visiting my parents who have moved to Seattle and bought a sprawling very modern home, where there is enough room for them to house my aunt Debbie and Uncle Kurt’s family, plus my brother’s family, plus myself and Mila who are just visiting for the weekend.

The sleep schedule is weird and no one tells Mila and I when it’s time to eat so finally I try to make a meal for the two of us and my aunt freaks out that I used ingredients she was going to use. I remember crying and being like I’m just trying to eat and I’m exhausted. 

The only downfall of the house, which overlooks Lake Washington or something AND has these beautiful mountain views ??? is that there’s basically no back yard, and my dad complains about this constantly. 

Long story short, one of the foreign exchange students my parents were housing was poisoning all of us by contaminating our food and drinking water with these quick dissolving gasoline pills. I was so pissed. 

### Second Dream
I have ended up in a murder house. Somehow I’ve become the plaything where I have to survive 7 assassins for four minute periods each to get out of the house alive.

I trick the first assassin into just chatting with me about her nails (they had poisoned tips but I really liked the vibrant colors). The other assassins are harder to escape, and I remember them being played by celebrities: Lenny Kravitz was one, Michael Rooker was another. They each had wild themed costumes and signature colors. 

I managed to escape but again I was starving so I went to McDonald’s and got stuck in the friggin labyrinth of all McDonald’s drive-thru lines and all I wanted was some french fries because I was starving again, in this second dream. I manage to escape the McDonald’s without food and end up in like a crazy warehouse next to the murder house with like 50 people I recognize from the Tri-Cities tech community. Our goal is to destroy the murder house so we break into two teams each and I’m trying to find a pen and paper to write down all the first names of the people on my team. 

Adam Baldwin is on my team and so I’m like awesome, yes. We find the carcass of the longest, thickest python snake imaginable interwoven through all of our cars. It’s too heavy to move. I ask for a count of hands on my team if anyone has ever played capture the flag or any kind of real life strategy game. This one girl puts her hand up and starts talking about her cell phone. Wtf. 

My pen ran out of ink. And then I woke up.

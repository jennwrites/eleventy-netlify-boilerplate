I want to say that I love coffee, but when I stop to think about it, it's actually lust. I crave coffee...black coffee, white mochas, americanos, gas station cappuchinos, you name it. But I know that it isn't actually true love because I have never really devoted myself to coffee. For one, I don't have a favorite brand of coffee bean or grounds. I don't even have a favorite coffee beverage. I do, however, have a favorite brand being the one featured in the photo: Second Cup.

Second Cup is by far the best brewed beverage these buds have ever tasted. It's so good, that I drank my entire latte before this photo was taken in Whistler. It was also January and I'm a stick person, so I think I needed the caffeine and warmth coursing through my veins to keep me alive. 

My tryst with Second Cup is more of a lust from afar relationship because the brand exists only in Canada. Why is it that Canadians always have all the things I think are cool? Accents, New Moon, Lunies and Tunies, Mike Myers and Second Cup.

It's not that I didn't try to ever get serious with coffee. I asked for an espresso machine (PET PEEVE FYI: When people say Expresso. I'm sorry, you're drinking the ostrich from N64 Donkey Kong? That's weird...I thought we were drinking Espresso!! Semantics get me all worked up) for Christmas, thinking I wouldn't get it but got it. Uh oh, someone has to learn how to make delicious coffee for themselves. 

Epic fail. I'm a baker, so I'm used to following recipes stringently. Coffee "recipes" aren't really recipes at all. For me they are more like coffee disasters. Good coffee takes practice, my beloved Erin tells me (pictured above, on the left) from her days as a barista extraordinare at Tullys. I guess.

But for the mean time I'll stick to slumming it up with that always available whore called Starbucks (seriously, I see her on every block) and is it weird that one of my favorite parts of drinking coffee is that first pee you take after?

1) Leave work to pick up child from daycare

2) Get child from daycare, proceed to vehicle.

3) Put child in car. Child complains, "Uhhh my chocolate milk spilled!"

4) Realize that child did not finish chocolate milk from seven hours ago.

5) Realize the chocolate smell in your car from earlier wasn't the essence of the coffee shop you had visited in the morning.

6) Realize the chocolate smell will only slightly mask the curdled milk smell  seeped into your car's upholstery for so long.

7) Proceed to handle "spill."

8) Discover, thankfully, that chocolate milk was contained by slightly fabric, slightly vinyl-esque folded up window shade.

9) Score!

10) Pick up window shade, careful not to drip chocolate milk in car. Intend to pour out in the street.

11) Catch a gust of wind and cover self and side of car with seven hours old chocolate milk when said window shade catches said wind and erupts open.

HAPPY FRIDAY!!!

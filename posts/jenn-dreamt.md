That her folks rented a place nearby in New York to be closer to her. Mila did not exist in this dream. In her dream, she went to high school again, where skateboarding was allowed in the halls, and she was able to ollie higher than she ever did in real life, which was very handy being the new girl in school. Also, a lot of the skaters were also surfers, and the beach was right off the green lawn at school. The skaters and sharks had a symbiotic relationship. Also, Jenn took all English courses.

At home, her folks rented a palatial apartment, where she lived with her sister, her brother and his family, her friend Sabrina, and a random obese young guy who rode only in a scooter around his area of the apartment. The rooms were strange, in that each “room” had about 2 rooms with smaller beds like full-sized, 1 massive “master” room with a king size bed, a living room, a sitting room, a couple of bathrooms of alternating size, and a formal office area. 

Different amazing rooms were also located off of different “bedrooms” for example, an amazing home theater was off of the scooter kid’s room, a massive sauna/hot tub/therapy room was located off of Sabrina’s room, and a 5-star bar/wine cellar was located off of Tondi’s room. I spent most of my dream exploring the apartment (which was multi-floor and also like multi-million dollar cost) and could never find my parents “master suite” since their “room” was the largest in the apartment. I had the smallest “room”. 

And they bragged constantly about how renting this apartment was cheaper than the mortgage on their home in the Tri-Cities.

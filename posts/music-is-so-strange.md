In that I just put my headphones on to work on a piece of writing and turned Muse on, and my daughter just kept elaborating the plot of Shrek Forever After to me. And the music (from the Absolution album) is so back and forth between hauntingly beautiful and gut spilling cathartic for me that it was such an odd moment.

Just watching her eyeballs and the intensity of her expressions felt like a such an odd, voyeuristic moment. It felt like watching scenes from someone else's life and I fell in love with her all over. I know she'll make me grumpy before I go to bed, but what a crazy privilege to know someone from the time they are a few cells to now. I can't ever forget this.

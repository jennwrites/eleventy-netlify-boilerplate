I'm not sure why, but being included on this thread on Twitter this past Friday night, really disappointed me.

Maybe it's because I'm still feeling all of that hopey-changey stuff we talked about at TriConf.

Maybe it's because I was surrounded by my friends and family to celebrate my sister's wedding and this just seemed so far off base. 

Maybe it's because I had to address sexist remarks made publicly to me at TriConf, and my bandwidth on such matters is spent. 

Maybe it's because as I'm learning more about myself, I'm finding it easier to respect other people's boundaries because I understand the importance of having them in the first place.

For me, this conversation went from light-hearted witty banter to something that gave me an overwhelming sense of ickiness.  

I can take a joke. But this was some dumb humor that belongs somewhere betwixt friends, away from the eyes and ears of the internet for all to see.

I can't specifically pinpoint the source of my discontent, other than to say a boundary was crossed, in my opinion. And in discussing my problem with it with Lee, he pointed out that had the roles been reversed, and one of his lady friends had been tweeting at him about vaginas, I would have been livid.

I would have been livid. And demanding of apologies. And so angry about all of the layers of disrespect, blah blah blah, but you get what I mean?

Just ickiness. 

And for the first time ever, I found myself contemplating a Twitter break.

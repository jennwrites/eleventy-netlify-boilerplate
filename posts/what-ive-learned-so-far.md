> “It was all a dream. I used to read ‘Word Up’ magazine.” Notorious B.I.G.

Well that quote gives you almost zero context but it was the first thing that popped into my head when I started thinking about writing my experience being a yeti in this first year.

Before I launch into the nitty gritty, here’s some actual context:

* I knew Amy Lynn, our Art Director, from CWU. We worked on the student newspaper, The Observer, together and shared in miscellaneous shenanigans. We were Facebook friends, so she was the gateway.
* My dad pointed me in the direction of &yet in 2010, when I moved back to Washington State from Florida. He also pointed me to MM3 Design, who happened to be hiring at the time.
* I wrote up a (now embarrassing) blurb on &yet when I was a writer for The Perfect Move (salesy realtor magazine), much to the chagrin of a certain individual, who will remain nameless.
* Prior to getting hired at &yet, I’d spent almost a year as a technical editor/writer at Mission Support Alliance, where I fought daily to be treated by the terms of my statement of work (contract), instead of an administrative assistant (reality). It was an incredibly frustrating, disheartening experience that I was ultimately let go from for standing up to my manager for exactly what I just described.

It’s kind of crazy how one of the things I feared most – being fired from a “dream job” (by my hometown standards) ended up paving the way for me to actually join my dream team, &yet.

The past year, erm 18 months, hasn’t been without its ups and downs. Transitioning from a highly chauvinistic, patriarchal, buttoned-up government operation to the familial, anti-command-and-control, trust-based team took a great deal of deprogramming on my part and patience from my teammates.

I wouldn’t even say I’m fully recovered, or to the point where I’m reaching my full potential – yet. At least now I believe it’s possible and can actually see it happening.

So here are my three key takeaways from my time so far at &yet.

### 1) I am my own worst enemy.
Maybe you're thinking, duh. Or maybe you're humming the Lit lyrics, which I won't quote here.

Sounds cliche, but it's true.

I know I’m not the only one afflicted with severe self doubt, but up until recently, I questioned myself like an egocentric teenage girl. Surely, if someone gave me critical feedback, it was rooted in something personal. They didn’t like me.

Or they were one hundred percent correct, which meant that I was in all likelihood a horrible, embarrassing failure, and how soon was everyone else going to realize that?

Oh my gosh, can you even imagine trying to communicate something important to that person? How scary. So...counseling.

Actually reading this book [Positive Intelligence](https://www.positiveintelligence.com/resources/) helped immensely and I highly recommend it, or the [Positive Intelligence website](https://www.positiveintelligence.com/) which you can visit and take an assessment on your positive intelligence quotient and most common self “saboteurs.”

Oh, and logic helps. One day, I just had to sit and think.

Actually make an effort to be quiet and still and just ponder. I really, really admire and trust my teammates. So it follows that *if* they think I’m a talented person and valuable teammate, and *if* I really trust and admire them legitimately, then I must legitimately be a talented person and a valuable teammate.

Simple logic that blows my self doubt poisoned mind. I still slip back into that mode some times. Or it finds new places to undermind me. Old habits die hard.

I’m hoping that soon I’ll be too busy to notice those thoughts any longer.

### 2) When it’s family, it’s different.
A lot of my teammates (myself included) describe our work environment like a second family. Because we are.

Working here is a dream come true for my eldest child tomboy self. Now I have close to 15 brothers, and most of them older! (I always wished for an older brother who just thought I was the coolest, is that normal? Oh well...I’m not).

Everyone seemed impressively cool when I first started, but it wasn’t until I ran into actual conflicts that I fully understood &yet was a family. Instead of being scorned and disciplined for my problems, I was heard out, given a chance to explain myself and encouraged to find solutions.

I did spend a lot of time feeling like a malnourished, abused, homeless child who had been adopted by an amazing, fabulous family of optimists.

It took me a long time to realize that love is the root of our family culture. It's the same thing that's at the root of every family when you strip away everything else completely. Just a bare bones love for the people you grow with – that's the heart of &yet.

There's something crazy that happens when you start to comprehend, I'm not going to say understand, because whoa–who *really* understands love?–the level of acceptance that comes from being around people who consistently show their love for you. It frees you up to be you.

And hopefully, motivated by that love, it encourages you to become the best you. Which I think is something we all aspire to, and try to help others on the team work toward too.

### 3) I’m responsible for me and for being the best me.
So once you've moved past the sort of preconceived employee-minded hangups and entered into the self-actualization of using your actual gifts to contribute to the company – it hits you.

Everyone is super awesome, and I get to be on their super awesome team.

Oh shit, I have to be super awesome.

Then the pressure is really on.

In my time at &yet I’ve run into this crux of the "creative" worker (tbh what the developers do with their code is amazingly creative, but for the sake of context my role is largely writing and marketing which is traditionally viewed as creative, whereas coding would be more technical). During projects which require my skills I’m busy as a bee, thriving and churning out that glorious honey. Yeah, baby. But, once the project is over and I’m side-lined as a non-code writing contributor, an epic struggle with self begins –

“What do I even do here?”
“Am I valuable to the team?”

I think it only *seems* a more common affliction among the non-developer roles in our company, but I'm starting to see that in between ongoing projects, developers run into that same panic as well.

But sometimes it still really messes with me.

Like if I sit and think about the level to which we write code, execute projects, produce conferences, and then try to evaluate where my writing skills fit in there...well, I feel like a jackass.

But, I also know that I have the support of my teammates to air my (mostly invalid) concerns, a bajillion resources at my disposal to help me get unstuck, and then there's that crazy motivating force of love that spurs me on to want to help create things with my team that interest us, help other humans and quite possibly have the potential to help make the world a better place.

It's also led me to expand my skill set and do video production from beginning to end, learn git, organize a community conference, submit a talk to a conference in Canada, and continue to challenge my thinking and writing.

And fail a bunch in there too, but still live. And be okay with that.

Working here has changed my life, definitely for the better, but I think the best part is that working at &yet isn't the end all I thought it would be.

It turned out to be just the beginning.
